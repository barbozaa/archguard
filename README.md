## 🎯 What is ArchGuard?

**ArchGuard is NOT a linter.** Use ESLint for code style. Use Prettier for formatting.

ArchGuard detects **architectural and design problems** that ESLint cannot — cross-file coupling, layer violations, parameter group smells, and code duplication patterns. It focuses exclusively on issues that require whole-project analysis.

### Who is this for?

**👨‍💼 Engineering Managers & Tech Leads**
- Objective metrics on architecture quality and coupling risk
- Data-driven decisions about refactoring priorities
- Executive summary format for non-technical stakeholders

**👨‍💻 Senior Engineers & Architects**
- Enforce architectural boundaries automatically
- Identify coupling hotspots and design smells
- Guide refactoring with concrete, prioritized findings

**👥 Development Teams**
- Catch architectural issues before code review
- Learn from actionable, specific feedback
- CI/CD integration to block regressions

## 📋 Architecture Rules

ArchGuard analyzes your codebase with **6 specialized rules** in 3 categories. Every rule requires whole-project analysis — things ESLint cannot do.

| Category | Rules | Multiplier |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 🏗️ **Structural** | Layer Violations · Feature Boundaries | **1.2×** |
| 🎨 **Design** | Too Many Imports · Shotgun Surgery · Data Clumps | **1.0×** |
| 🧹 **Hygiene** | Duplicate Code | **0.5×** |

---

### 🏗️ Layer Violation — `critical`

Detects imports that violate configured architectural layer boundaries.

**Why it matters:** A UI file importing directly from infrastructure bypasses your application layer, creates tight coupling to implementation details, and makes the layer boundary meaningless.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Presentation layer importing Infrastructure directly
// src/presentation/UserProfile.tsx
import { database } from '../../infrastructure/database/client';

// ✅ GOOD: Go through Application layer
// src/presentation/UserProfile.tsx
import { getUserById } from '../../application/user/queries';
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "layerRules": {
      "presentation": ["application", "domain"],
      "application": ["domain"],
      "domain": [],
      "infrastructure": ["domain"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Layer detection is path-based. Layer names must match a directory segment (`presentation`, `application`, `domain`, `infrastructure`, `infra`, `ui`).

---

### 🏗️ Feature Boundary — `critical`

Enforces horizontal isolation between feature modules. Prevents `features/auth` from importing `features/payments` unless explicitly allowed.

**Why it matters:** Without feature boundaries, business features become entangled — making independent deployment, team ownership, and future extraction into separate packages impossible.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Auth feature importing directly from payments
// src/features/auth/login.ts
import { validateCard } from '../../features/payments/validator';

// ✅ GOOD: Use shared module or event-driven communication
// src/features/auth/login.ts
import { notify } from '../../features/shared/events';
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "boundaryRules": {
    "enforce": true,
    "boundaries": [
      { "feature": "features/auth",     "allowImportsFrom": ["features/shared"] },
      { "feature": "features/payments",  "allowImportsFrom": ["features/shared", "features/auth"] },
      { "feature": "features/shared",    "allowImportsFrom": [] }
    ]
  }
}
```

> Feature matching uses path prefixes. A file at `features/auth/login.ts` belongs to the `features/auth` boundary.

---

### 🎨 Too Many Imports — `warning`

Detects files with excessive import statements (default: >15).

**Why it matters:** High import count is a reliable signal that a file has too many responsibilities and is tightly coupled to the rest of the codebase.

| Count | Severity |
|-------|----------|
| > 25 | `critical` |
| > 15 | `warning` |

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "too-many-imports": {
      "maxImports": 15
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 🎨 Shotgun Surgery — `info` / `warning`

Detects exported symbols (classes, functions) used across many files (default: ≥5).

**Why it matters:** When a single symbol is imported in dozens of files, any change to it forces modifications across the codebase — high blast radius, high regression risk.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: OrderConfig used directly in 12 files
// Changing it requires touching 12 files

// ✅ GOOD: Introduce a facade or service
export class OrderService {
  // Centralizes access — downstream files are insulated from changes
}
```

| File count | Severity |
|------------|----------|
| ≥ 10 | `warning` |
| ≥ 5 | `info` |

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "shotgun-surgery": {
      "minFiles": 5
    }
  }
}
```

> Interfaces, type aliases, and enums are excluded (type-only symbols don't cause runtime coupling). Utility modules (`/utils/`, `/helpers/`, `/shared/`) are also excluded.

---

### 🎨 Data Clumps — `warning`

Detects the same group of 3+ parameters appearing together in multiple functions (default: ≥3 occurrences).

**Why it matters:** Repeating parameter groups signal a missing abstraction — those parameters belong together in a type or class.

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Same 3 params in 5 functions
function createReport(userId: string, startDate: Date, format: string) {}
function validateReport(userId: string, startDate: Date, format: string) {}
function sendReport(userId: string, startDate: Date, format: string) {}

// ✅ GOOD: Extract into a type
interface ReportRequest { userId: string; startDate: Date; format: string; }
function createReport(request: ReportRequest) {}
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "data-clumps": {
      "minOccurrences": 3
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 🧹 Duplicate Code — `info` / `warning` / `critical`

Detects identical code blocks (≥5 lines) appearing in multiple files.

**Why it matters:** Duplicated logic means bugs must be fixed in multiple places and behavior drifts over time.

| Files with duplicate | Severity |
|----------------------|----------|
| ≥ 5 files | `critical` |
| ≥ 3 files | `warning` |
| 2 files | `info` |

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "duplicate-code": {
      "minLines": 5
    }
  }
}
```

> Test files are excluded from duplicate detection. Boilerplate patterns (closing braces + return statements) are filtered out to reduce false positives.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create `archguard.config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "srcDirectory": "./src",
  "rules": {
    "too-many-imports": { "maxImports": 15 },
    "shotgun-surgery": { "minFiles": 5 },
    "data-clumps": { "minOccurrences": 3 },
    "duplicate-code": { "minLines": 5 },
    "layerRules": {
      "presentation": ["application", "domain"],
      "application": ["domain"],
      "domain": [],
      "infrastructure": ["domain"]
    }
  },
  "boundaryRules": {
    "enforce": true,
    "boundaries": [
      { "feature": "features/auth",    "allowImportsFrom": ["features/shared"] },
      { "feature": "features/payments", "allowImportsFrom": ["features/shared"] },
      { "feature": "features/shared",   "allowImportsFrom": [] }
    ]
  }
}
```

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `srcDirectory` | `"."` | Directory to analyze |
| `too-many-imports.maxImports` | `15` | Max import statements per file |
| `shotgun-surgery.minFiles` | `5` | Min files for a symbol to flag |
| `data-clumps.minOccurrences` | `3` | Min occurrences for a parameter group to flag |
| `duplicate-code.minLines` | `5` | Min lines for a duplicate block |
| `layerRules` | `{}` | Layer dependency rules |
| `boundaryRules` | disabled | Feature isolation boundaries |

## 📈 Scoring System

ArchGuard calculates an **Architecture Health Score (0–100)**.

### Formula

```
architecturePenalty = structural.penalty × 0.50 + design.penalty × 0.35
architectureScore   = 100 − normalize(architecturePenalty)

hygienePenalty      = hygiene.penalty
hygieneScore        = 100 − normalize(hygienePenalty)

score               = architectureScore × 0.8 + hygieneScore × 0.2
```

### Normalization by project size

Penalties are scaled down for larger projects to account for the fact that more code means proportionally more surface area for issues.

| Project size | Normalization |
|-------------|---------------|
| ≤ 5,000 LOC | None (penalty applied as-is) |
| 5k – 50k LOC | `penalty × (5000 / LOC)^0.3` |
| 50k – 200k LOC | `penalty × (5000 / LOC)^0.4` |
| > 200k LOC | `penalty × (5000 / LOC)^0.5` |

### Status thresholds

| Score | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 90–100 | ✨ Excellent |
| 75–89 | 💚 Healthy |
| 60–74 | ⚠️ Needs Attention |
| 0–59 | 🚨 Critical |

### Coupling metrics (informational)

In addition to the score, ArchGuard reports **Ca/Ce/Instability** (Robert Martin's package metrics):

- **Ca (Afferent Coupling)** — how many modules depend on this module
- **Ce (Efferent Coupling)** — how many modules this module depends on  
- **Instability I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)** — 0 = stable, 1 = unstable
- **Blast Radius** — top 5 modules by number of dependents

## 🔀 Architecture Diffing

Compare architecture health between git branches — the killer feature for CI.

```bash
# Compare current branch against main
archguard . --diff main
```

```
  Architecture Diff Report
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Base branch:  main
  Head branch:  feature/new-module
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Score:  95 → 92  (-3)
  Violations:  2 → 5

  ✗ 3 New Violations
    • [warning] Too Many Imports: File has 18 imports (max: 15)
      src/features/checkout/service.ts:1
    ...

  ✓ Resolved Violations
    (none)

  ↓ Verdict: Architecture DEGRADED
```

Use `--format json` for machine-readable output and `--fail-on-error` to block PRs that introduce new violations.

## 🤖 MCP Server (AI Integration)

ArchGuard includes a Model Context Protocol server, allowing LLMs (Cursor, Claude, etc.) to analyze your architecture directly.

```bash
# Run the MCP server from npm package
npm exec --yes --package=@barbozaa/archguard --call "archguard-mcp"
```

**Available tools:**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `analyze_architecture` | Full analysis with score, violations, coupling metrics |
| `get_violations` | Filtered violations by rule, severity, or file path |
| `get_coupling_risk` | Ca/Ce/Instability metrics, hub detection, blast radius |
| `explain_violation` | Detailed explanation of any rule (what, why, fix) |
| `compare_branches` | Architecture diff between two git branches |

**Cursor MCP config** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "archguard": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": [
        "exec",
        "--yes",
        "--package=@barbozaa/archguard",
        "--call",
        "archguard-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🔌 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Architecture Check
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  architecture:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npx @barbozaa/archguard . --diff origin/main --fail-on-error
```

> `fetch-depth: 0` is required so git worktree can access the base branch.

### Fail on critical only

```bash
# Only fail CI on critical violations (ignore info/warning)
npx @barbozaa/archguard . --format json | node -e "
  const r = require('fs').readFileSync('/dev/stdin','utf8');
  const data = JSON.parse(r);
  process.exit(data.violations.some(v => v.severity === 'critical') ? 1 : 0);
"
```
